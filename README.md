PHP_Weather
===========

This package encapsulates SimpleXML functions for easy retrieval of weather data
from the [Yahoo Weather API](http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/). It
was created as part of the PHP_Webcam_Overlay package but is released as a
separate component so it can be used in other packages.

Because it was created as a dependency of the PHP_Webcam_Overlay package, it
does only support a subset of the available weather data.

System-Wide Installation
------------------------

PHP_Weather should be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net).
This installer is the PHP community's de-facto standard for installing PHP
components.

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.random-host.com
    sudo pear install --alldeps randomhost/PHP_Weather

Usage
-----

A basic approach at using this package could look like this:

```php
<?php
namespace randomhost\Weather;

require 'psr0.autoloader.php';

// get Yahoo Weather API Feed instance
$feed = new Yahoo\Feed(667931, Yahoo\Feed::UNITS_INTL);

echo sprintf(
    'Temperature: %sÂ°%s, Humidity: %s%%',
    $feed->getCondition()->getTemperature(),
    $feed->getUnits()->getTemperature(),
    $feed->getAtmosphere()->getHumidity()
);
```

This will instantiate the class, fetch the weather data and display current
temperature and humidity.

Assuming that you named this file `weather.php`, you should now be able to
access the weather data at `http://example.com/weather.php`

A more detailed example can be found in `src/www/weather/index.php` which will
also be installed to your PEAR www directory (usually `/usr/share/php/htdocs`).

### The Feed object

The `Feed` object is the primary object you will interact with in your application.
It provides all methods required for retrieving data from the Yahoo! Weather API.

#### Constructor

The constructor takes 3 parameters which are all optional:

- `$locationId`  
Location ID (WOEID) for retrieving weather data from the Yahoo Weather API.

- `$systemOfUnits`  
System of units to be returned by the feed. This must be either `Feed::UNITS_INTL`
or `Feed::UNITS_US`.

- `$feedUrl`  
Feed URL for retrieving weather data from Yahoo Weather API.

If a `$locationId` is given, `Feed::fetchData()` will be called implicitly which
will automatically retrieve weather data for the given location ID and populate
the data access objects accordingly.  
If you do not want this, you can omit `$locationId` or set it to `0` and configure
the location ID yourself using `Feed::setLocationId()`.

The `$systemOfUnits` parameter can be used to determine the system of units to
be used by the weather feed. If not given or set to `''` (an empty string), it
defaults to using international units (Celsius, kilometers, millibars).

`$feedUrl` defines the feed URL for retrieving weather data from the Yahoo!
Weather API. This parameter does not usually need to be changed unless Yahoo!
changes their API.

#### Configuring the feed

The following public methods for configuring the weather feed are available:

- `setFeedUrl($feedUrl)`  
Sets the feed URL for retrieving weather data from the Yahoo! Weather API.

- `getFeedUrl()`  
Returns the last set weather API feed URL.

- `setLocationId($id)`  
Sets the location ID (WOEID) for retrieving weather data from Yahoo Weather API.

- `getLocationId()`  
Returns the last set location ID for retrieving weather data.

- `setSystemOfUnits($systemOfUnits)`  
Sets the system of units to be returned by the feed.

- `getSystemOfUnits()`  
Returns the last set system of units.

#### Retrieving data from the feed

The following public methods for retrieving data from the feed are available:

- `fetchData()`  
Fetches weather data from the Yahoo Weather API and populates the data access

Finding your WOEID
------------------

To find your WOEID, browse or search for your city from the [Yahoo! Weather home page]
(http://weather.yahoo.com/). The WOEID is in the URL for the forecast page for
that city. You can also get the WOEID by entering your zip code on the home page.

For example, if you search for *Cologne* on the Weather home page, the forecast page
for that city is:

    http://weather.yahoo.com/germany/north-rhine-westphalia/cologne-667931/

The WOEID is 667931.

As A Dependency On Your Component
---------------------------------

If you are creating a component that relies on PHP_Weather, please make sure that
you add PHP_Weather to your component's package.xml file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <required>
    <package>
      <name>PHP_Weather</name>
      <channel>pear.random-host.com</channel>
      <min>1.0.0</min>
      <max>1.999.9999</max>
    </package>
  </required>
</dependencies>
```

Development Environment
-----------------------

If you want to patch or enhance this component, you will need to create a
suitable development environment. The easiest way to do that is to install
phix4componentdev:

    # phix4componentdev
    sudo apt-get install php5-xdebug
    sudo apt-get install php5-imagick
    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
    sudo pear -D auto_discover=1 install -Ba phix/phix4componentdev

You can then clone the git repository:

    # PHP_Webcam_Overlay
    git clone https://github.com/Random-Host/PHP_Weather.git

Then, install a local copy of this component's dependencies to complete the
development environment:

    # build vendor/ folder
    phing build-vendor

To make life easier for you, common tasks (such as running unit tests,
generating code review analytics, and creating the PEAR package) have been
automated using [phing](http://phing.info).  You'll find the automated steps
inside the build.xml file that ships with the component.

Run the command 'phing' in the component's top-level folder to see the full list
of available automated tasks.
